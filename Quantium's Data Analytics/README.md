# Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Experience

This repository contains my work from the **Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Experience** on [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/), where I completed a job simulation focused on **Data Analytics** and **Commercial Insights**.

## 📌 Overview

The simulation provided hands-on experience with real-world data analytics tasks performed by Quantium’s data science team. The main goal was to analyze transaction data, extract insights, and make data-driven recommendations to improve business outcomes.

##  Key Tasks Completed:

- **Data Cleaning & Preparation:** Processed transaction datasets to ensure data quality and consistency.
- **Customer Analytics:** Performed exploratory analysis to understand customer behavior and purchasing trends.
- **Store Benchmarking:** Identified appropriate control stores to compare with trial stores for uplift testing.
- **Uplift Analysis:** Evaluated the impact of a new product layout on trial stores using metrics like total sales and customer counts.
- **Reporting:** Prepared clear, insight-driven reports for the Category Manager to guide commercial decisions.
